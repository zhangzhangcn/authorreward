AuthorReward is implemented as an extension to [MediaWiki](https://www.mediawiki.org/). It has been tested on [RiceWiki](http://ricewiki.big.ac.cn) (a community-curated resource of rice knowledge).

For testing purposes, we chose the semi-dwarfing gene (sd1), which is one of the most important genes deployed in modern rice breeding and known as the "green revolution gene" affecting plant height of rice. There are multiple researchers collaboratively annotating the sd1 gene and yielding 87 versions.

As a consequence, AuthorReward performs a standard practice to reward their contributions, viz., quantifying their contributions, ranking them according to their contribution scores, providing the explicit authorship and delivering a citable reference for this gene (Figure 1).

The sd1 gene is a live demo illustrating the functionality of AuthorReward, which is freely accessible at http://ricewiki.big.ac.cn/index.php/Os01g0883800.
